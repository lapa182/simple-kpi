# simple-kpi
Just a simple KPI Dashboard that I've developed in free-time to use on my current company. Basically it reads an excel file, converet it to JSON and the developer fill the objectives blanks and submit to the Project Owner. The project isn't finished, but the idea was made.

- Used NodeJS + ExpressJS
- Node-Sass
